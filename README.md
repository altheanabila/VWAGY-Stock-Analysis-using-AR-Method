# VWAGY-Stock-Analysis-using-AR-Method

This time, I have made an Auto regressive model of Volkswagen group stock ($VWAGY). 

1. First of all we need to download the csv data from yahoo finance and extracting the data into panda data frames.


2. We use Autoregressive model to obtain the forecasted values


3. and then we need to create residual values on forecasted values
